# wincy-yu-bg-layout-practice-2-28-22

The FOCUS of this assignment is to build a SIMPLE responsive web page layout with Bootstrap grid (at least 1).

practice.html:
This page is for you to experiment with bootstrap grid
It can be as messy as you need it to be
You should experiment with writing many different combinations of Row and column classes
Feel free to experiment with different containers, 
Feel free to copy and paste different layouts from other tutorials and take a look at their behavior
You can stick to the most heavily used bootstrap grid classes (breakpoint-columns#) or you can look through the documentation for some fancy stuff.
The point of this to understand what these classes do, and to not feel any stress playing around with them (you want to avoid feeling inhibited when you are trying to learn the grid system conventions and understand how it works)

practice-2:
In a second HTML page you want to build a responsive layout with bootstrap grid.
You want this layout to look good on at least 3 different screen widths (can be more)
 Mobile, Half-screen, and fullscreen
You don’t need to add any real or fancy content  (though you can add some content and images if you want)
You can use filler text and images, or just empty divs
You can use simple colors to see your rows and columns easily
Your layout doesn’t need to be aesthetically beautiful in its colors, instead focus on the design and functionality of the responsive layout.
Will your layout display content well on all of the different screen sizes?
Your assignment is “done” when you have implemented a responsive page layout with Bootstrap Grid.
